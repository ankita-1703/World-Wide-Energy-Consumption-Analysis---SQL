# World-Wide-Energy-Consumption-Analysis-(SQL PROJECT) 
This project analyzes global energy data using SQL to uncover patterns in energy production, consumption, emissions, GDP, and population across countries and years. It provides meaningful insights into how energy use relates to economic growth and environmental impact.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Explores the relationship between energy metrics (production, consumption, emissions) and economic indicators (GDP, population).
Uses complex SQL queries for trend analysis, year-over-year comparisons, and per capita evaluations.
Identifies country-wise differences and global patterns to inform sustainable energy strategies.

ðŸ§  Key Insights Extracted
-Total emissions by country in the most recent year â€” identifying major polluters.
- Top countries by GDP and their correlation with energy demand.
- Contribution of various energy types (e.g., fossil fuels) to emissions.
- Year-over-year changes in global emissions and per capita trends.
- Emission-to-GDP ratio to evaluate environmental efficiency.
- Population growth impact on emissions and energy usage.
- Energy production per capita and GDP-energy production correlation.
- 
ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL)
- Relational database design
- Joins, aggregations, window functions, and data transformations

ðŸ“ˆ Outcomes
- Clear understanding of how energy consumption patterns vary by country and over time.
- Analytical foundation to support energy policy planning and sustainability goals.
- Insights ready to be visualized using BI tools (e.g., Power BI or Tableau).
